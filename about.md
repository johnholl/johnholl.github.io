## About me

Hello World, I'm John. I have at various points professionally been a mathematician, a machine learning researcher, a teacher, and a software developer. "Amateur Everything" comes from the fact that I like to learn and try all kinds of things in my spare time. Some of those things include windsurfing, sailing, cycling, woodworking, hardware, auto mechanics, and cooking. I live with my wife Haley, a brilliant English teacher, in Ypsilanti, Michigan.
